INSTALL R PACKAGES
Whether you?ve been using R or Python, you?re going to need to install these R packages. You can download all of the necessary R packages now and then install them each time you restart R. Just use the ?install? command listed below. You only need to do this once. Once they're installed, they are installed. 

```{r}
## Only install these packages the first time you do this. 
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("scales")
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("gridExtra")
install.packages("neonUtilities")
```


Part 1: Work With NEON's Plant Phenology Data

NEON Plant Phenology Observation Data

NEON collects plant phenology data and provides it as NEON data product DP1.10055.001.

The plant phenology observations data product provides in-situ observations of the phenological status and intensity of tagged plants (or patches) during discrete observations events.

Sampling occurs at all terrestrial field sites at site and season specific intervals. During Phase I (dominant species) sampling (pre-2021), three species with 30 individuals each are sampled. In 2021, Phase II (community) sampling will begin, with <=20 species with 5 or more individuals sampled will occur.

Status-based Monitoring
NEON employs status-based monitoring, in which the phenological condition of an individual is reported any time that individual is observed. At every observations bout, records are generated for every phenophase that is occurring and for every phenophase not occurring. With this approach, events (such as leaf emergence in Mediterranean climates, or flowering in many desert species) that may occur multiple times during a single year, can be captured. 

Continuous reporting of phenophase status enables quantification of the duration of phenophases rather than just their date of onset while allows enabling the explicit quantification of uncertainty in phenophase transition dates that are introduced by monitoring in discrete temporal bouts.

Specific products derived from this sampling include the observed phenophase status (whether or not a phenophase is occurring) and the intensity of phenophases for individuals in which phenophase status = ?yes?. Phenophases reported are derived from the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) categories. The number of phenophases observed varies by growth form and ranges from 1 phenophase (cactus) to 7 phenophases (semi-evergreen broadleaf). In this tutorial we will focus only on the state of the phenophase, not the phenophase intensity data.


Phenology Transects
Plant phenology observations occurs at all terrestrial NEON sites along an 800 meter square loop transect (primary) and within a 200 m x 200 m plot located within view of a canopy level, tower-mounted, phenology camera.


Timing of Observations

At each site, there are:
-- ~50 observation bouts per year.
-- no more that 100 sampling points per phenology transect.
-- no more than 9 sampling points per phenocam plot.
-- 1 annual measurement per year to collect annual size and disease status measurements from each sampling point.


Available Data Tables
In the downloaded data packet, data are available in two main files

phe_statusintensity: Plant phenophase status and intensity data
phe_perindividual: Geolocation and taxonomic identification for phenology plants
phe_perindividualperyear: recorded once a year, essentially the "metadata" about the plant: DBH, height, etc.

There are other files in each download including a readme with information on the data product and the download; a variables file that defines the term descriptions, data types, and units; a validation file with data entry validation and parsing rules; and an XML with machine readable metadata.
 
Work with NEON Data
When we do this for phenology data we get three files, one for each data table, with all the data from your site and date range of interest.


First, we need to set up our R environment.

Load needed packages-- You will need to do this EVERY time you start up RStudio to run this code

```{r}


# load needed packages-- You will need to do this EVERY time you start up RStudio to run this code
library(neonUtilities)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

options(stringsAsFactors=F) #keep strings as character type not factors

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where
# we want to save our files. Be sure to move the download into your working directory!
wd <- "~/Desktop/Data_Intensive_Ecology_2021/Phenology_Case_Study/" # Change this to match your local environment


```



Next we?ll need to load our data of interest. 
For this series, we'll work with data from the NEON Domain 02 sites:
--Blandy Farm (BLAN)
--Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI)
--Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC)


And we'll use data from January 2017 to December 2019. This downloads over 9MB of data. If this is too large, use a smaller date range. If you opt to do this, your figures and some output may look different later in the tutorial.

You can load the data into R one of two ways, both ways will work and both ways will give you the same data set so your choice. You only have to do one. Your choice. Only run the code for the one you choose. 

OPTION #1: DIRECT DOWLOAD FROM NEON

```{r}
##Option 1: You can download the data directly from the NEON site

#Read data from data portal 

phe <- loadByProduct(dpID = "DP1.10055.001", site=c("BLAN","SCBI","SERC"), 
										 startdate = "2017-01", enddate="2019-12", 
										 check.size = F) 
# if you aren't sure you can handle the data file size use check.size = T. 

# save dataframes from the downloaded list
ind <- phe$phe_perindividual  #individual information
status <- phe$phe_statusintensity  #status & intensity info




```


OPTION #2: If choosing to use example dataset downloaded from the Canvas site as a zipped file from this tutorial 


```{r}
##Option 2:If choosing to use example dataset downloaded from the Canvas site as a zipped file from this tutorial: 

# Stack multiple files within the downloaded phenology data
stackByTable("NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/filesToStack10055", folder = T)

# read in data - readTableNEON uses the variables file to assign the correct
# data type for each variable
ind <- readTableNEON('NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/filesToStack10055/stackedFiles/phe_perindividual.csv', 'NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/filesToStack10055/stackedFiles/variables_10055.csv')

status <- readTableNEON('NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/filesToStack10055/stackedFiles/phe_statusintensity.csv', 'NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/filesToStack10055/stackedFiles/variables_10055.csv')

```

So, now that your data is in R, let?s explore it! Let's get to know what the ind dataframe looks like.

This code gives you some different ways to look at the data in the ?ind? dataframe. Run the code line by line and see what each does. 
Notice that the neonUtilities package read the data type from the variables file and then automatically converts the data to the correct date type in R.
(Note that if you first opened your data file in Excel, you might see 06/14/2014 as the format instead of 2014-06-14. Excel can do some ~~weird~~ interesting things to dates.)

```{r}
## ----look-ind------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What are the fieldnames in this dataset?
names(ind)

# Unsure of what some of the variables are you? Look at the variables table! If you downloaded directly from NEON
View(phe$variables_10055)

# if using the pre-downloaded data from Canvas, you need to read in the variables file 
# or open and look at it on your desktop
#var <- read.csv('NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/filesToStack10055/stackedFiles/variables_10055.csv')
#View(var)

# how many rows are in the data?
nrow(ind)

# look at the first six rows of data.
head(ind) 

# look at the structure of the dataframe.
str(ind)

```

Now let?s look at the data in the ?status? dataframe: 

```{r}
## ----look-status---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What variables are included in this dataset?
names(status)
nrow(status)
#head(status)   #this is a good function to use but looks messy so not rendering it 
str(status)

# date range
min(status$date)
max(status$date)
```

Good. Now let?s take a minute and go ahead and clean up the data a bit. 

I?m cheating a bit here. I know what the data is and what it looks like, so I?m going to preemptively do some things here, but for most new datasets that you?re just starting to explore, you?re not going to necessarily know what these things are going to be before you start doing them. 


Clean up the Data:
--remove duplicates (full rows)
--join our dataframes
--retain only the most recent editedDate in the perIndividual and status table.


Remove Duplicates
The individual table (ind) file is included in each site by month-year file. As a result when all the tables are stacked there are many duplicates.
Let's remove any duplicates that exist.

```{r}
## ----remove-duplicates---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# drop UID as that will be unique for duplicate records
ind_noUID <- select(ind, -(uid))

status_noUID <- select(status, -(uid))

# remove duplicates
## expect many

ind_noD <- distinct(ind_noUID)
nrow(ind_noD)

status_noD<-distinct(status_noUID)
nrow(status_noD)

```


Now we have 2 dataframes that have been cleaned of duplicates. You have named them "ind_noD" and "status_noD". Next, we're going to join these 2 dataframes to create a single dataframe that we analyze and visualize



JOINING DATAFRAMES

Variable Overlap between Tables
From the initial inspection of the data we can see there is overlap in variable names between the fields.

Let's see what they are by using the ?intersect? command

```{r}
## ----same-fieldnames-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# where is there an intersection of names
intersect(names(status_noD), names(ind_noD))
```


There are several fields that overlap between the datasets. Some of these are expected to be the same and will be what we join on.

However, some of these will have different values in each table. We want to keep those distinct value and not join on them. Therefore, we can rename these fields before joining:
date
editedDate
measuredBy
recordedBy
samplingProtocolVersion
remarks
dataQF
publicationDate

measuredBy

Now we want to rename the variables that would have duplicate names. We can rename all the variables in the status object to have "Stat" at the end of the variable name.


```{r}
## ----rename-column-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# in Status table rename like columns 

status_noD <- rename(status_noD, dateStat=date, 
										 editedDateStat=editedDate, measuredByStat=measuredBy, 
										 recordedByStat=recordedBy, 
										 samplingProtocolVersionStat=samplingProtocolVersion, 
										 remarksStat=remarks, dataQFStat=dataQF, 
										 publicationDateStat=publicationDate)

```

Filter to last editedDate: This is a bit more data cleaning up to get to the specific data that we want. 

The individual (ind) table contains all instances that any of the location or taxonomy data of an individual was updated. Therefore there are many rows for some individuals. We only want the latest editedDate on ind.


```{r}
# retain only the max of the date for each individualID
ind_last <- ind_noD %>%
    group_by(individualID) %>%
    filter(editedDate==max(editedDate))

# oh wait, duplicate dates, retain only the most recent editedDate
ind_lastnoD <- ind_last %>%
    group_by(editedDate, individualID) %>%
    filter(row_number()==1)
```

Join Dataframes
Now we can join the two data frames on all the variables with the same name. We use a left_join() from the dpylr package because we want to match all the rows from the "left" (first) dataframe to any rows that also occur in the "right" (second) dataframe.

Check out RStudio's data wrangling (dplyr/tidyr) cheatsheet for other types of joins. It is posted in Canvas. 
```{r}
# Create a new dataframe "phe_ind" with all the data from status and some from ind_lastnoD
phe_ind <- left_join(status_noD, ind_lastnoD)

```

Congratulations, you've now created a dataframe called "phe_ind". It has the combined data from "ind_lastnoD" and "status_noD". You used the variables "namedLocation", "domainID", "siteID", "plotID", and "individualID" to combine the two dataframes. 


Now that we have clean datasets we can begin looking into our particular data to address our research question: do plants show patterns of changes in phenophase across season?

###################################################################

DO PLANTS SHOW PATTERNS OF CHANGES IN PHENOPHASE ACROSS SEASON?


What are we doing here? The next few chunks of code are us selecting exactly what variables of interest we want to see. You're going to see a pattern in the code. The first line is going to ask R to produce a list of the values that there are for that variable. It's asking for a list of unique variables. Then you're going to tell R to select just one of those values using the filter command. Finally, you're going to check that it actually worked by again asking for the unique values in that variable. This time you should ONLY see the value you selected to be filtered. Try this out. 

Patterns in Phenophase
From our larger dataset (several sites, species, phenophases), let's create a dataframe with only the data from a single site, species, and phenophase and call it phe_1sp.

Select Site(s) of Interest
To do this, we'll first select our site of interest. Note how we set this up with an object that is our site of interest. This will allow us to more easily change which site or sites if we want to adapt our code later.

```{r}
# set site of interest
siteOfInterest <- "SCBI"

# use filter to select only the site of Interest 
## using %in% allows one to add a vector if you want more than one site. 
## could also do it with == instead of %in% but won't work with vectors

phe_1st <- filter(phe_ind, siteID %in% siteOfInterest)
```

Select Species of Interest
Now we may only want to view a single species or a set of species. Let's first look at the species that are present in our data. We could do this just by looking at the taxonID field which give the four letter UDSA plant code for each species. But if we don't know all the plant codes, we can get a bit fancier and view both

```{r}
# see which species are present - taxon ID only
unique(phe_1st$taxonID)



# or see which species are present with taxon ID + species name
unique(paste(phe_1st$taxonID, phe_1st$scientificName, sep=' - ')) 


```

For now, let's choose only the flowering tree Liriodendron tulipifera (LITU). By writing it this way, we could also add a list of species to the speciesOfInterest object to select for multiple species.

```{r}
speciesOfInterest <- "LITU"

#subset to just "LITU"
# here just use == but could also use %in%
phe_1sp <- filter(phe_1st, taxonID==speciesOfInterest)

# check that it worked
unique(phe_1sp$taxonID)


```

Select Phenophase of Interest

And, perhaps a single phenophase. Let's choose "Leaves".
```{r}
# see which phenophases are present
unique(phe_1sp$phenophaseName)


phenophaseOfInterest <- "Leaves"

#subset to just the phenosphase of interest 
phe_1sp <- filter(phe_1sp, phenophaseName %in% phenophaseOfInterest)

# check that it worked
unique(phe_1sp$phenophaseName)

```

Select only Primary Plots
NEON plant phenology observations are collected along two types of plots.

Primary plots: an 800 meter square phenology loop transect
Phenocam plots: a 200 m x 200 m plot located within view of a canopy level, tower-mounted, phenology camera
In the data, these plots are differentiated by the subtypeSpecification. Depending on your question you may want to use only one or both of these plot types. For this activity, we're going to only look at the primary plots.

```{r}
# what plots are present?
unique(phe_1sp$subtypeSpecification)



# filter
phe_1spPrimary <- filter(phe_1sp, subtypeSpecification == 'primary')

# check that it worked
unique(phe_1spPrimary$subtypeSpecification)


```

Total in Phenophase of Interest

The phenophaseState is recorded as "yes" or "no" that the individual is in that phenophase. The phenophaseIntensity are categories for how much of the individual is in that state. For now, we will stick with phenophaseState.

We can now calculate the total number of individuals with that state. We use n_distinct(indvidualID) count the individuals (and not the records) in case there are duplicate records for an individual.

But later on we'll also want to calculate the percent of the observed individuals in the "leaves" status, therefore, we're also adding in a step here to retain the sample size so that we can calculate % later.

Here we use pipes %>% from the dpylr package to "pass" objects onto the next function.

```{r}
# Calculate sample size for later use
sampSize <- phe_1spPrimary %>%
  group_by(dateStat) %>%
  summarise(numInd= n_distinct(individualID))

## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

# Total in status by day for distinct individuals
inStat <- phe_1spPrimary%>%
  group_by(dateStat, phenophaseStatus)%>%
  summarise(countYes=n_distinct(individualID))

## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'dateStat' (override with `.groups` argument)

inStat <- full_join(sampSize, inStat, by="dateStat")

# Retain only Yes
inStat_T <- filter(inStat, phenophaseStatus %in% "yes")

# check that it worked
unique(inStat_T$phenophaseStatus)
```


Now that we have the data we can plot it.

Plot with ggplot
The ggplot() function within the ggplot2 package gives us considerable control over plot appearance. Three basic elements are needed for ggplot() to work:

1) The data_frame: containing the variables that we wish to plot,
2) aes (aesthetics): which denotes which variables will map to the x-, y- (and other) axes,
3) geom_XXXX (geometry): which defines the data's graphical representation (e.g. points (geom_point), bars (geom_bar), lines (geom_line), etc).

The syntax begins with the base statement that includes the data_frame (inStat_T) and associated x (date) and y (n) variables to be plotted:

Here's the command in its proper syntax: ggplot(inStat_T, aes(date, n))

Bar Plots with ggplot
To successfully plot, the last piece that is needed is the "geom"-etry type. To create a bar plot, we set the geom element to geom_bar().

The default setting for a ggplot bar plot - geom_bar() - is a histogram designated by stat="bin". However, in this case, we want to plot count values. We can use geom_bar(stat="identity") to force ggplot to plot actual values.

```{r}
# plot number of individuals in leaf
phenoPlot <- ggplot(inStat_T, aes(dateStat, countYes)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", na.rm = TRUE) 

phenoPlot

```

Now let's make it a bit more presentable...

```{r}
# Now let's make the plot look a bit more presentable
phenoPlot <- ggplot(inStat_T, aes(dateStat, countYes)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", na.rm = TRUE) +
    ggtitle("Total Individuals in Leaf") +
    xlab("Date") + ylab("Number of Individuals") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold", size = 20)) +
    theme(text = element_text(size=18))

phenoPlot
```

We could also covert this to percentage and plot that.


```{r}
# convert to percent
inStat_T$percent<- ((inStat_T$countYes)/inStat_T$numInd)*100

# plot percent of leaves
phenoPlot_P <- ggplot(inStat_T, aes(dateStat, percent)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", na.rm = TRUE) +
    ggtitle("Proportion in Leaf") +
    xlab("Date") + ylab("% of Individuals") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold", size = 20)) +
    theme(text = element_text(size=18))

phenoPlot_P
```

The plots demonstrate the nice expected pattern of increasing leaf-out, peak, and drop-off.


####################################################################

DRIVERS OF PHENOLOGY

Now that we see that there are differences in and shifts in phenophases, what are the drivers of phenophases?

The NEON phenology measurements track sensitive and easily observed indicators of biotic responses to climate variability by monitoring the timing and duration of phenological stages in plant communities. Plant phenology is affected by forces such as temperature, timing and duration of pest infestations and disease outbreaks, water fluxes, nutrient budgets, carbon dynamics, and food availability and has feedbacks to trophic interactions, carbon sequestration, community composition and ecosystem function. (quoted from Plant Phenology Observations user guide.)

Filter by Date
In the next part of this series, we will be exploring temperature as a driver of phenology. Temperature date is quite large (NEON provides this in 1 minute or 30 minute intervals) so let's trim our phenology date down to only one year so that we aren't working with as large a data.

Let's filter to just 2018 data.
```{r}
# use filter to select only the date of interest 
phe_1sp_2018 <- filter(inStat_T, dateStat >= "2018-01-01" & dateStat <= "2018-12-31")

# did it work?
range(phe_1sp_2018$dateStat)
```

How does that look?


```{r}
# Now let's make the plot look a bit more presentable
phenoPlot18 <- ggplot(phe_1sp_2018, aes(dateStat, countYes)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", na.rm = TRUE) +
    ggtitle("Total Individuals in Leaf") +
    xlab("Date") + ylab("Number of Individuals") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold", size = 20)) +
    theme(text = element_text(size=18))

phenoPlot18
```

Now that we've filtered down to just the 2018 data from SCBI for LITU in leaf, we may want to save that subsetted data for another use. To do that you can write the data frame to a .csv file.

```{r}
# Write .csv 
# This will write to your current working directory, change as desired.
write.csv( phe_1sp_2018 , file="NEONpheno_LITU_Leaves_SCBI_2018.csv", row.names=F)
```

So, that's it for Part 1. You've gone through, cleaned up the phenology data, joined it to create a single dataframe and focused your scope down to a single year, location, species, and phenophase. 

You then saved that to a new .csv file.

Next, how does temperature affect leaves in LITU at the SCBI site? In the next part we're going to wrangle that temp data. In Part 3 we'll bring these two pieces together to get the full picture. Yeah!!
