DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------

ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.10111.001

Name: Site management and event reporting

Description: This data product contains records of land management activities, disturbances, and other incidents of ecological note within all NEON sites

NEON Science Team Supplier: Terrestrial Observation System

Abstract: This data product contains records of land management activities, disturbances, and other incidents of ecological note within all NEON sites. Records are reported about management activities and disturbances that have the potential to impact or affect data products across all NEON data-generating systems (TIS, TOS, AIS, AOS, and AOP) that are not collected as part of existing data product protocols. For additional details, see the user guide, protocols, and science design listed in the Documentation section in this data product's details webpage.

Latency: The expected time from data and/or sample collection in the field to data publication is as follows, for each of the data tables (in days) in the downloaded data package. See the Data Product User Guide for more information.

sim_eventData: 60

Brief Design Description: Site management activity and disturbance reporting occurs at the time NEON staff are aware of the planned or unplanned event, either through direct observation during normal scheduled site visits or secondary reports from landowners, site hosts, and other reliable sources. For planned events, reporting is expected to occur only after the management activity has been started. For unplanned events, data recording takes place as soon as the disturbance is observed as well as when it is safe to assess the scale and intensity of the impact.

Brief Study Area Description: These data are collected at all NEON aquatic and terrestrial sites.

Keywords: management activities, reduction, wind, human disturbances, harvesting, chemical application, wildlife disturbances, event reporting, irrigation, natural disturbances, land management, flood, frost, drought, tillage, grazing, population spike, fire, species addition, site management


DATA PACKAGE CONTENTS

This data product contains up to 1 data tables:

sim_eventData - Record of land management activities, disturbances, and other incidents of ecological note within a NEON site
If data are unavailable for the particular sites and dates queried, some tables may be absent.
Basic download package definition: The basic download package contains all of the data. An expanded download package is not available for this product.

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------

NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via NEON's data portal or API. Please visit https://www.neonscience.org/data-formats-conventions for a full description of the naming conventions.

ISSUE LOG
---------

This log provides a list of issues that were identified during data collection or processing, prior to publication of this data package. For a more recent log, please visit this data product's detail page at https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10111.001.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------

Taxonomic identification of species of concern have been 'fuzzed'; see data package readme files for more information.

Protection of species of concern: At most sites, taxonomic IDs of species of concern have been 'fuzzed', i.e., reported at a higher taxonomic rank than the raw data, to avoid publishing locations of sensitive species. For a few sites with stricter regulations (e.g., Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM)), records for species of concern are not published. 

NEON DATA POLICY AND CITATION GUIDELINES
----------------------------------------

A citation statement is available in this data product's detail page at https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10111.001. Please visit https://www.neonscience.org/data-policy for more information about NEON's data policy and citation guidelines.

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------

NEON data are initially published with a status of Provisional, in which updates to data and/or processing algorithms will occur on an as-needed basis, and query reproducibility cannot be guaranteed. Once data are published as part of a Data Release, they are no longer provisional, and are associated with a stable DOI.
